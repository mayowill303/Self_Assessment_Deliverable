## Self_Assessment_Deliverable
Working on this project was exciting, challenging as well as rewarding.  I took on several roles throughout the project.  From scheduling meetings, setting up our github, preparing our google slide framework to implementation of our dashboard.  This including the testing and validation of machine learning code and database integrations.  

My team mates Bree and Amy did the heavy lifting of sourcing the data and prepare scripts for machine learning and database models.  While I spent time on the validation of the implementation in preparation for the dashboard creation for visualization.  I went through several interations of trial and error with other visualization tools but ended up using Tableau. 

I ran into several challenges with matplotlib and website frameworks before ultimately landing on Tableau as a comprehensive tool.  I collaborated with Chris in the line graph creation, Bree on the machine learning visuals and Amy provided guidance on sourcing errors in efforts to overcome challenges.

## Team Assessment
Our teamwork was highspeed in the beginning as we all dove into our roles.  We met regularly with updates and next steps.  I don't think we began the dashboarding till much later in the grand scheme.  We used Slack, Zoom and Project Planning Gantt Chart to communicate and monitor our progress.  

Each team member thrived in their roles and shared any challenges they had in efforts that other team members could assist as needed. 

I thought our daily communications via slack was very helpful.  We met during class in addition to days we had no class to collaborate on code, github and presentations.

## Summary of Project
There is currently no consensus on the average last freeze date. In our project, we pulled historical weather data and observation station data to pinpoint last freeze dates in order to build a model to predict future last freeze dates in the region based. We were able to find historical data available in a JSON format.

We wanted to answer questions about what has been the historical average last freeze date, Is there an accurate way to predict the last freeze date and do previous temperatures and/or precipitation levels have an impact on last freeze date in the spring.  

In efforts to understand the historical weather data available within the dataset and identify which values would be ideal for the Machine Learning Model, we pulled in data in JSON and CSV formats.

We cleaned data with Python Pandas and Wrote Data to Postgres DB.  

Following our data cleaning step, we created several calculated values for dashboard charts/graphs and machine learning, and exported the data.

We explored options for presentation of our data and used Tableau.
